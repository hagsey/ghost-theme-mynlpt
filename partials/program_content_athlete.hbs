  <h1 class="program-top">NLPTathlete</h1>
  <p>For athletes in the Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo area, there is no better environment to train in than NLPT. Our intimate, and hard-working atmosphere creates an environment that simply can not be replicated in your typical “gym”.</p>

  <p>You’ll also find that our coaches are some of the most experienced and knowledgeable in the area. Aside from their athletic and academic accomplishments (see Staff page), they believe in setting a good example for all athletes by preaching hard-work, accountability, and consistency both at and away from the gym.</p>

  <h2 class="subsection" id="NLPTathlete" data-id="1">NLPTathlete</h2>

  <p>NLPTathlete is a fully-individualized training system designed to match the needs of both the athlete and the athlete’s sport. Each athlete begins with an assessment and movement screen in order to give coaches an idea exactly where the athlete stands and how to training process should begin.</p>

  <h3>Programming</h3>

  <img class="image-right" src="/assets/images/content-image-2.jpg">
  <p>All programs are designed with considerations for the athlete's, age, specific training goals, injury history, physical capabilities and playing schedules. We believe in teaching the core fundamentals of training and building athletic skills in a systematic and age-appropriate way. Our programs are comprehensive and balanced, emphasizing movement skills, speed and power training, strength development, and energy system work all while making sure the athlete is training safely and responsibly.</p>

  <h3>Environment</h3>

  <p>Many of our athletes and families have told us that our programming methodology goes much beyond a simple workout plan. As coaches, we see it as our responsibility not only write a good program, but create the right environment where that program's potential can be fulfilled. The training environment here is one of accountability, hard work, fun and getting results.</p>

  <h3>Coaching</h3>

  <p>NLPT boasts the most experienced and educated coaching staff in the region. All of our coaches have pursued either kinesiology, human kinetics, or fitness and health degrees at the post-secondary level and beyond. They are fully certified and have lengthy athletic credentials to their name. But beyond their expertise, our coaching staff invests an incredible amount of care and attention into everyone at the gym. The #NLPTfamily is more than just a hashtag, it’s a core principle of our gym.</p>

  <h2 class="subsection" id="hp" data-id="2">High Performance Hockey Program</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/content-image-9.jpg">

<p>Our High Performance (HP) program takes place during the summer months and is for the athlete who is 100% committed to their hockey development. The training, nutritional and on-ice demands are extensive and require a high degree of commitment.</p>

<p>There are two components to the HP program: Strength and conditioning, and on-ice skills development. You can find all the information on last year’s program (HP2016) by watching this 20-minute webinar presented by Director of Training, Eric Hagemann. Details on 2017’s program are still in the works, but you can read about our program’s philosophy and design below.</p>
<iframe class="hp-video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgFM-OGQQZo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h3>Strength and Conditioning</h3>

<h4>Phase 1 (May - June)<h4>

<p>The emphasis of the first phase of the program is on creating a large foundation of strength, aerobic fitness, and on learning effecient movement mechanics. The volume will gradually increase over these first 8-weeks in preparation for the intense on and off-ice demands of Phase 2. </p>

<h4>Phase 2 (July - August)<h4>

<p>The next phase will progress to more power, speed and energy system specific training as the beginning of the competitive season approaches. Competition and difficulty of this phase will be very high and athletes must be prepared to work and do what is required outside of the gym (nutrition, recovery) to be prepared to train.</p>
Nutrition and Massage
<p>Unlike 10 years ago, it’s no longer just about the training. Nutrition and recovery are now crucial components to an athlete’s development plan and our 2017 program will provide support on both fronts.</p>

<p>Athletes will be required to fill out and submit weekly nutrition logs which will be evaluated by the NLPT coaching and therapy staff, who will then provide feedback and structured guidance on developing sound athlete-centered nutrition habits. Additionally, pre and post-workout Biosteel supplementation will be provided for each training session. </p>

<p>The HP2017 program will have built in recovery weeks and workouts at strategic points in the summer to ensure athletes stay fresh and ready to perform at times. Pro, NCAA, and OHL athletes will also be provided with complimentary weekly 30-minute massage therapy sessions.</p>

<h3>On-Ice Skills Development</h3>

<img class="image-right" src="/assets/images/walker.jpg">

<p>The HP2017 Program will offer world class coaching provided by Scott Walker (Vancouver Canucks Player Development Coach, World Junior Gold Medalist, OHL Champion, 15 years NHL Experience), Todd Harvey (OHL Champion, World Junior Gold Medalist as player and 10-years NHL experience) and Matt Smith (Guelph Storm Goalie Coach).</p>

<p>Athletes of all age categories will have three on-ice sessions each week (30-hours of ice time total). The first two sessions will focus on high tempo individual skill development and the third on will be a scrimmage where the NLPT HP2017 coaching staff will be providing coaching from the bench. </p>

<h3>HP Pricing and enrollment</h3>

<p>We will be releasing details on enrollment in January 2017. Please sign up for our newsletter to receive details as soon as they become available.</p>

<h2 class="subsection" id="youth" data-id="3">Youth Program</h2>

<p>Athletes between the ages of 10 to 13 fall into our Youth Development Program category. While these young athletes still get treated the same as any other athlete at NLPT, we approach their programming with a slightly different philosophy than our older clientele.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/content-image-10.jpg">

<h4>Young athlete’s are not mini-adults</h4>

<p>We don’t believe that young athletes should “train like the pro’s.” Call us crazy, but we believe kids should train like kids. This means starting with the fundamentals, keeping the exercises interesting, and educating the athlete about their body, how it moves, and how to train.</p>

<h4>Quality first</h4>

<p>This is not the age to be overly focused on immediate outcomes. It’s all about quality. We emphasize proper mechanics and technique above anything else at this age. Success in athletics, as in many things in life, comes by being consistent for a long period of time. These young athletes are at the beginning of their journey, and we believe it should start by learning to do the basics, and learning them well.</p>

<h4>Global approach</h4>

<p>Strength and speed are the common athletic traits most people think of when they imagine great athleticism. But there are other athletic qualities that must be developed at this very special age that many coaches neglect. For example: balance, rhythm, coordination, spatial awareness, and reactiveness are all important athletic qualities that should play a big role in the program of a young athlete.</p>

<h4>Attentiveness</h4>

<p>Athletes that simply go through the motions are wasting their time. With our youth program, we emphasize drills and exercises that require their full attention in order to be performed correctly. The purpose behind this is to facilitate the motor learning process, which requires purposeful movement. Mindless reps are soon forgotten.</p>

<h4>Accountability</h4>

<p>We’ve discovered that when put in the right environment, many young athletes are capable of a lot more responsibility than they’re given credit for. We don’t hold anyone’s hand and we don’t babysit. While we try to keep a friendly atmosphere in the gym, we make it very clear to all athletes that they’re here to train. ALL athletes are expected to show up on time, begin their warm-up on their own, stay on task, be respectful, and put all equipment away.</p>

<h3>Youth Program FAQ</h3>

<p><em>"Are they going to be lifting weights?"</em></p>

<p>Parents that ask this question usually have an image in their mind of either a barbell on their child’s back or a set of heavy dumbbells in their hand. To this image, the answer is no. However, that’s not to say that we won’t apply load to the body. Application of load or stress is what tells the body to grow, so naturally we have to do something to create this response. We prefer to apply this load with the use of bodyweight exercises at this stage in their development. Although we will sometimes use light weights as a tool to help us safely achieve this goal.</p>

<p><em>"I have a daughter, is there a girls program she can enroll in?"</em></p>

<p>No. We have a lot of female athletes at NLPT and everyone trains together.</p>

<p><em>"Do you do (insert sport of choice here) specific training?"</em></p>

<p>Not at this age. We don’t create specialized training programs for any particular sport at this stage in their development. That is something that comes much later. At this age, we feel that all athletes should be working on their overall athleticism and learning to perform the basics well. However, because most sports have more commonalities than differences, the chances are that their performance will improve as a result of the training. So in that sense, the answer is yes! Any form of training that improves performance is considered sport-specific. It just so happens that the same form of training can improve performance in a multitude of sports.</p>

<p><em>"How often should my kid train?"</em></p>

<p>We have options for 2 or 3 times per week in our program. However, for newer trainees, we have found that great results can be achieved with as little as 2 sessions per week.</p>

<p><em>"My kid needs to get faster."</em></p>

<p>Among other things. As described above, there are a lot of athletic qualities we’ll be working on with your son or daughter. Speed will come as a result of them getting stronger (they’ll be able to push harder into the ground), and improving their mechanics (they’ll be more efficient in their movement).</p>
