      <p>We are a small gym. We have no investors. No partners. No sponsors. And we’re very proud of that.</p>

      <p>We believe in creating an intimate, hard-working training atmosphere where everyone gets the attention they need. We believe in providing top-notch coaching and program design. And we believe that in order to stay healthy and get the best results, training needs to be customized to the individual.</p>

      <p>Beyone the X's and O's of training, we’re also an incredibly family-oriented gym. We have a small, close-knit staff that has a lot history together. Many of the coaches are even former NLPT athletes who developed a passion for coaching and are now a part of our staff, grooming along the next wave of young athletes.</p>

      <p>Thank you for taking some time to learn more about our gym.</p>
