        <h1>Family Discount</h1>
        <p>It's not uncommon for clients to discover NLPT through a family member. Sometimes a parent signs their child up only to discover that NLPTfit would be a great program for themselves. Other times multiple siblings wish to train together. However it comes about, we're always honored when family members choose to train with us. However we know that things can quickly get expensive. So as a way of saying thank you, we provide a <b>10% discount to each family member's program cost.</b> </p>
